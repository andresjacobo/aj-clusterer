# What is the AJ Clusterer Library?

A lightweight, easy to use, multi-threaded clustering library for use with the Google Maps JavaScript API.
It was inspired by the excellent MarkerClusterer library. Compared to MarkerClusterer, this library offers less
flexibility, but has two distinct advantages:
1. It is arguably easier to use (And has cuter default icons!).
2. It takes advantage of multi-threading on modern clients to achieve better performance and dramatically more 
responsiveness when dealing with large datasets.
